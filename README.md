This Webtool allows the user to have full access to the available Insanity Nutrition Guide, but with the benefit of being able to select and pre-plan meals for the week. You can now stop messing with the book or .pdf and finally focus on training with a single trip to the store. http://timothycarambat.github.io/insanitymealplanner
